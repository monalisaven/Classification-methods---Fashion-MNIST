# Classification methods---Fashion MNIST
Machine learning

Performance comparison of classification algorithms over a set of data (MNIST dataset - https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification)
Compariston of Acurracy and F1 score of:
- Nearest Neighbor k-NN with Eucleadean distance
- Nearest Neighbor k-NN with cosine distance
- Neural Networks with signoid activation function( 1 hidden layer with 500 hidden neurons)
- Neural Networks with signoid activation function( 2 hidden layers with 500 and 200 hidden neurons )
- SVM - Linear kernel
- SVM - Gaussian kernel
- SVM - Cosine kernel
- Naive Bayes classifier
